# Galaxy Shooter

Galaxy Shooter is my first game in Unity. Basically is result of
[The Ultimate Guide to Game Development with Unity Official](https://udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-guide-to-game-development-with-unity). Course is intended for very early beginners, who doesn't code before. I knowing C# from university that's why my implementation vary significantly in some places from the proposed one. It was bad coding lessons, but good with introduction to Unity environment.
